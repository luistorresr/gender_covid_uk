# How is COVID-19 impacting women and men’s working lives in the UK?
# The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way we work. It has created job loss, work instability, financial hardship and great insecurity. It is generating deep problems for much of
# the working population in the UK, but it also impacts in starkly different ways on different groups of worker. This project is comparing how the pandemic is impacting the 
# working lives of women and men. In collaboration with the UK Women’s Budget Group, it is examining how the workplaces of women and men, and the very experience of work, have been impacted as the pandemic effects rolled out in 2020 and into 2021.

The research asks whether the pandemic is narrowing or reinforcing existing gender inequalities in our ways of working. Has it created new inequities? To answer these crucial questions, the project is analysing data gathered from very many workers, and very different workplaces, across the whole of the UK.

This research will allow us to: • Track key labour force changes as the effects of the pandemic rolled out e.g. are there differences among women and men in their levels of unemployment, their hours worked and typical earnings?
• Identify variation in the impact of COVID-19 on workplaces e.g. which businesses were most likely to close, what was the extent of remote working, and did all of this vary by the gender composition of the workers? • Track over time workers’ worries about, for example, pandemic-induced changes to their hours of paid work, and how to balance the demands of their paid work with intensified caring demands?

The project will rapidly fill an urgent need. It will start to disseminate early findings and urgent policy solutions.
