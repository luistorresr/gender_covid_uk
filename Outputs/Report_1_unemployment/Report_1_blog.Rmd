COVID-19 has struck men's health more severely than women's. [More men died or ended up in hospitals from the virus](https://globalhealth5050.org/the-sex-gender-and-covid-19-project/the-data-tracker/?explore=country&country=England#search). However, COVID-19 has proven to be not solely a health-crisis. The lockdowns and social distancing measures are not affecting everyone equally on socio-economic levels. Responses of businesses and the government to mitigate the impacts of virus, such as flexible working and the job retention scheme, are not effective for all kinds of jobs. Our research (Link to the Research report) shows that the response to the COVID-19 pandemic is worsening the pre-pandemic inequalities in employment between genders in ethnic minorities. We also show that in particular young and working class groups have been hit the hardest by unemployment during the course of the pandemic.

We use the UK's largest study on employment circumstances, the Labour Force Survey (LFS), which draws on data gathered on the working lives of thousands of workers.

### Men's employment rose most steeply

Before the COVID-19 pandemic struck, the official unemployment levels in the UK stood at one of the lowest recorded. After the first lockdown took in effect unemployment levels rose for everyone, but for men most steeply. At its peak in the summer of 2020 about 1 in 19 men and 1 in 21 women could not find a job when they wanted to.

Economic crises generally affect men's employment worse than women's. For instance because men work in sectors heavily hit by closures. But women are also less likely than men to report themselves unemployed. They more often take up full-time caring roles in the home after job loss, encouraged by the structure of the UK's welfare system.

### A widening ethnic gap in unemployment levels

Men have been impacted more when overall unemployment is considered. But this overall picture conceals that gender impacts vary with age, ethnicity and occupation. The existing gap in unemployment between white and minority-ethnic workers widened after the start of the pandemic, while 2020 started with a gap of 3%, by the end of 2020 this was 5%. The pandemic has thus intensified the pre-pandemic ethnic penalty and especially for women. For example, women from Indian, Pakistani, non-Chinese Asian and other ethnic background suffered a greater increase in unemployment than men from these backgrounds.

### Working class workers faced the most persistent problems into 2021 

Our research also revealed that while some recovery in employment is visible from 2021, those in the working class are facing more persistent problems. These workers in (semi-)routine jobs are essential workers whose crucial roles was highlighted during the pandemic: cleaners, drivers, assemblers, machine operators, porters and messengers, plumbers, shop workers and care workers.

### Who was made redundant?

Redundancies were also particularly high in the working class. Although men in management jobs were at greatest risk of redundancy, the pandemic barely impacted the overall employment in these occupations. The redundancy for women in management roles was very high too. However, women are more likely to be employed in the public sector, in particular health, which have been largely protected against redundancies.

The main reason for the high amount of redundancies seems to be that employers are cutting staff. As non-essential businesses were experiencing long periods of inactivity as a result of COVID-19 closures and other pressures, many employers opted for fewer employees to carry out the available work. The percentage of people who lost their jobs because of workplaces reducing staff shot up rapidly after the first lockdown, peaking at 38% of all redundancies in summer 2020.

It is known that men's employment suffers the most in periods of economic crisis. Our analysis has shown that the COVID-19 pandemic is no different in this respect. Overall, men have been faced with higher unemployment and redundancies. However, the impact of the pandemic varies with age, ethnicity and occupation as well as gender. Rapidly rising rates of job loss because of employers cutting back on staff paint a worrying picture about work during the pandemic. Especially for workers whose experiences were already shaped by intersecting inequalities of gender, class and ethnicity. Yet unemployment levels do not tell the full story. In our next report, we look at precariousness: how precarious has our work become and which groups are most affected?
