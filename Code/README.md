# Code  

The code in this folder includes all the activities involved in importing data, cleaning it, running analysis, and creating visualizations for this data.

Rep_1, Rep_2 and Rep_3 are the topic specific analysis. Only relevant tables and visualizations are taken to the /Outputs folder to build the interactive reports in html.
